<!-- Introduction:
What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose
to implement? -->

Savvy rooted from the thought of inspiring young adults like myself, who loves techy stuff to the extend as games.
Savvy aims to create a community of like-minded people, and share the idea to the world that sports and career paths 
can also be digital, not just physical, breaking the social norms. Thus, although Savvy was created for like-minded young adults,
people of all age and gender are welcomed to explore and join the world of tech and esports.

For the structure, I decided to use the Hierarchical Structure. As Savvy is a newspaper magazine, it includes a lot of different
webpages and links, in which users can get lost. Hierarchical Structure includes categorization of different topics and subtopics.
It acts like a tree with the trunk being the home page, branching out into different categories and webpages like Tech, Physics, etc..

<!-- Inspiration:
State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website (e.g. guest speakers,
websites, artists, blogs). -->

1. National Geographic Website - Upon designing my website, I looked through multiple newspaper websites and one that stood out to 
me the most was National Geographic. It had so many interactive animations, amazing structure and navigation of pages, and very 
interesting interface and I wanted to implement it to my website.

2. Free Frontend - An open source website which shares coding resources. While creating my website, I looked into free frontend and 
discovered unique designs and effects which helped me add new features into my website.

3. Free CSS - An open source CSS templates and layouts website. This is where I got inspiration of different designs and ideas of 
multiple magazine websites.

<!-- Accessibility:
State 3 ways in which your site is accessible. -->

1. Alt Images - I added alternate text for each and every image in the website. This helps visually impaired users as the screen readers 
can read the description or meaning of the images to the user.

2. Responsiveness - The resizablility of the website allows users to access the website, not only on computers, but also mobile phones 
and tablets. This ensures that the broadest range possible of users can access the website. Responsiveness also allows consistency of 
design and navigation across different devices so that it is easier for users to remember where each features lies. For example, images 
becoming smaller, and converted to verticallyfrom side by side when used on a phone compared to a laptop.

<!-- Usability:
State 3 ways in which you considered the usability of your site. -->

1. Design - Buttons and texts are labelled specifically and simply to allow users to understand each function easily. The design, 
color palette, layout of the website are also kept consistent across different webpages, creating a cohesive and user-friendly experience. 
This also allows users to navigate through the website easily as the same features will be placed in similar areas through different pages.
In addition, Carousel effect is added in multiple areas of the website to allow users to navigate to different pages easily and efficently, 
while also keeping the website neat, tidy, and compact. Carousels are made sure not to include any "autoplay" to aid users with screen readers, 
or keyboard navigation as they might miss the information if the slides change too fast, and so that it wouldn't be too distracting for users 
when they are reading.

2. Error Handling - Specific error messages are displayed to the user which instructs the users well on how to fix the errors. Thus, when 
a known error occurs, users can fix it quick without the need to wait a certain time contacting the customer service. An FAQ section is 
also added, which includes about common errors that may occur due to certain user activities on the websites, as well as general questions 
about the website, making it convenient and easy for the users.

3. Search - A search bar is implemented in both the home page as well as the faq page, which allows users to promptly find out specific 
information that they are looking for on the website. It navigates them to the correct pages, making it easier and a hassle-free process 
for the users. Search bars also include an auto complete function, which suggests available options to the users. This saves time for the 
user as they do no need to type the entire search query, reduces errors of mistype leading to "no results", and provides accurate searches 
as it displays only existing queries/suggestions. All in all, search bars with auto complete features make the navigation process of the 
website easier for the user. 

<!-- Learning:
State 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How did you achieve that? -->

1. Structure - During the designing phase, I had to research on how most magazine websites are structred or made, what it includes and 
what it does.

2. Accessibility - During the coding phase, I researched and learnt more about how to make my website accessibile to as wide of an 
audience group as possible. This includes catering for visually impaired users by adding alt text, 

3. Autocomplete feature - While implementing the search bar, I wanted to add an autocomplete box, which would increase the usability, 
and ease of navigation of the website. To learn this, I went onto free frontend, W3School and youtube to look up several different ways 
people have created an autocomplete box. I took some ideas and added them together to form my version of the autocomplete box with my own 
design.

<!-- Evaluation I:/Web Development/Savvy/physics.html
What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful? Why? -->

I think the main aspects that were successful is the design of the project. I am proud of the beautiful design i was able to come up with,
such as the placing of the elements, cohesiveness of the entire website, interactions such as search bar and carousel effects and most
importantly the parallax effects that I have added in. As I have able to come up with both the design and codes in a matter of days, I 
find design and codes the most successful aspect. 

<!-- Evaluation II:
What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things differently another time? -->

The one aspect I had trouble on was making the search bar flawless. Currently, I face a problem with the search button which does not allow
me to click on the suggested queries in just one click. I would have to click it twice in order to go to the next pages. This is mainly due 
to the fact that I did not have enough time due to my poor time management skills and that time management could be improved for me. Next 
time, I will make sure to start my projects earlier so that I have enough time for bug fixes and making my project much nicer.

<!-- Resources:
What resources did you use in your work? List any sources of information, libraries, plugins,
code or tools (you should also indicate inclusions from other sources within your code using
comments) -->

1. Free Frontend - It helped provide HTML, CSS and HTML codes for specific features which I took inspiration from

2. CodePen - It is an online editor that allows parts/features to be coded separately from the website, without needing to 
worry about linking, by using HTML, CSS and HTML. This helped me fix, try or add new features without changing the codes for the 
entire website.

3. W3School - It helped me a lot in learning the functionalities of what each code does. 

4. StackOverFlow - This question and answer site helped me solve some of the problems/errors I faced during coding by looking up 
solutions in the site of other people that faced similar problems as me.
